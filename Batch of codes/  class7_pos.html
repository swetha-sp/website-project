        <!-- <h2>position: static</h2>
            <p>This static tag dosen't work in any special way
                this gives the normal position that is default position of the page

            </p>
            <br />
            
            <div class="static">This element is positioned as in static</div>
            <p>The HTML elemnts are in default position as in static</p>

         <!-- <h2>position: relative</h2>
         <p>The element with this positioned relative to its normal position
             it doesn't affect anything it affects itself
             But  in the case of the margin if we change it affects everything
         </p>
         <div class="relative">This element is positioned according to the relative
         </div>
         <p>Here it just shifted it position to  given pixel
             if we shift 30 px we can scroll the screen to the right
         </p> -->
    
        <!-- <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1000px">position: fixed</h2>
        <p>This tag fixes the html elemnts to a position of top,bottom,right,left
            and even when we scroll the page it stays there and it is still visible to us when we scroll
        </p>
        <div class="fixed">This element is positioned in fixed tag</div> -->
    
<!--     
        <h2>position: absolute</h2>
        <p>this tag allows to position with respect to the relative 
            or parent tag
            when there is no parent tag it will be positioned according to the whole screen.
        </p>
        <div class="relative">
            This is positioned according to the relative
            <div class="absolute">This is positioned according to the absolute</div>
        </div>
        <p> so here the position of the absolute always act according to the relative that is parent tag</p> -->
    
       <!-- <h2 > position: sticky</h2>
       
       <div class="sticky">I am sticky</div>
       <p style="margin-bottom: 1000px;">this tag allows us to position the tag even when we scroll the page and its remaines in the same place 
        As  we see in the static
    </p>
       <p ></p>here this tag remains static unless we scroll the page 
           this is the difference between them
       </p> -->
